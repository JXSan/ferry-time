# Last Minute / Ferry Time
This application is for commuters who travel back and forth from Staten Island via the Ferry. The purpose of this application is to tell users the estimated time of arrivals of certain vessels travelling between Manhattan and Staten Island, New York.

# What we want to accomplish:
- Live feed of the ferries 
- Calculate estimated time of arrival of each individual ferry 
- Be able to determine when the ferry is 'in route', 'docking', or 'docked'
- Determine which slip (door) the ferry doors will be opening 
- Find out when the doors open or close 

# How the application will work:
- Open the application
- You are presented with an option to choose between the two terminals (St Georgre vs Whitehall)
- Upon clicking a terminal, you will be presented with the 'Home Page' where it will show the ETA of the approaching ferry
- There will also be seperate tabs (Live Feed, Ferry Schedule, Contact)


# Live Feed
  - This tab will display a live Google Maps representation of the ferry 
# Ferry Schedule
  - This tab will be a static image (or table) of the ferry departure schedule
# Contact 
  - This tab will be used to contact the developers (us) for any feedback regarding the application
